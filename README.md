Non Preemptive-Shortest Job First :-Non preemptive mean not releasing cpu
                           its totally depend on burst time .in this situation if we give cpu to any process its first execute fully then release cpu, then we can give cpu to  another process.
                           This report provides the solution to "How a scheduler allocates the CPU to processes according to SJRF algorithm".
